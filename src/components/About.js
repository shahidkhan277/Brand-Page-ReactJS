            <h1>Stories, style, and sporting goods at Nike, since 1949</h1>
            <p>Through sports, we have the power to change lives. Sports keep us fit. They keep us mindful. 
                They bring us together. Athletes inspire us. They help us to get up and get moving. And sporting goods featuring the latest technologies 
                help us beat our personal best. 
                adidas is home to the runner, the basketball player, the soccer kid,
                 the fitness enthusiast, the yogi. And even the weekend hiker looking to escape
                  the city. The 3-Stripes are everywhere and anywhere. In sports. In music. On
                   life is stages. Before the whistle blows, during the race, and at the finish 
                   line. We are here to support creators. To improve their game. To live their 
                   lives. And to change the world.<br></br>

                adidas is about more than sportswear and workout clothes. We partner with the best in the industry to co-create. 
                This way we offer our fans the sporting goods, style and clothing that match the athletic needs, while keeping sustainability in mind.
                 We are here to support creators. Improve their game. Create change. And we think about the impact we have on our world.</p>
